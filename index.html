        <h2>What Is Donor Relations and Stewardship?</h2>
        <p>
          Donor relations and stewardship are the practices that help an organization say thank you,
          communicate impact, and build ongoing relationships with donors. Stewardship is more than
          a single letter or event. It is a cycle of gratitude, transparency, and engagement that
          encourages donors to feel connected to the mission over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donor relations work often includes writing acknowledgment letters, organizing events,
          reporting on the impact of gifts, and making sure donors feel seen, appreciated, and
          informed. Strong stewardship can lead to stronger trust, continued support, and a more
          vibrant community of donors.

        <p>
          This site offers a short, practical introduction to donor relations and stewardship in a
          university or nonprofit setting. It is not a complete manual, but it highlights some of
          the core ideas behind this work.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thank You & Acknowledgments</strong> — writing meaningful donor messages.</li>
          <li><strong>Events & Engagement</strong> — how events support stewardship.</li>
          <li><strong>Data & Follow-Up</strong> — why recordkeeping matters.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Donor relations and stewardship work best when they are intentional, consistent,
          and grounded in the values of the institution. The pages that follow will walk through
          some of these building blocks.

        <h2>Events as Stewardship, Not Just Logistics</h2>
        <p>
          Donor events can be powerful tools for stewardship when they focus on connection and impact,
          rather than simply filling a calendar. Whether the event is a scholarship luncheon, a small
          reception, or a large gala, the goal is to bring donors closer to the mission and the people
          their gifts support.
        </p>
        <p>
          When event planning is guided by clear goals, the details—timelines, seating charts, and
          run-of-show documents—support a deeper stewardship purpose instead of becoming an end in
          themselves.

        <h3>Common Types of Stewardship Events</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scholarship Luncheons:</strong> Bring donors together with scholarship recipients to share stories and experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Recognition Dinners:</strong> Celebrate giving societies or milestone anniversaries of support.</li>
          <li><strong>Campus Tours and Open Houses:</strong> Invite donors to see facilities, programs, or student work in person.</li>
          <li><strong>Small Gatherings:</strong> Provide opportunities for intimate conversations with leadership or students.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Event Planning Checklist</h3>
        <p>
          This simple checklist can be used as a starting point when planning a stewardship-focused event.
          Every institution and event is different, but these steps help keep the work organized and intentional.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Define the purpose:</strong> Clarify why you are hosting the event and what you hope donors will take away from it.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify the audience:</strong> Decide who should be invited, such as specific donor groups, scholarship donors, or community partners.</li>
          <li><strong>Select date, time, and location:</strong> Check for conflicts with other campus events and choose a space that matches the event's tone.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm budget and resources:</strong> Outline costs for catering, printing, décor, technology, and staff support.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan the program:</strong> Draft a simple run-of-show, including speakers, student or recipient stories, and time for conversation.</li>
          <li><strong>Prepare invitations and registration:</strong> Create clear, friendly invitations and set up a way to track RSVPs.</li>
          <li><strong>Coordinate with campus partners:</strong> Connect with facilities, catering, IT, and security as needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Finalize details:</strong> Confirm headcount, seating, scripts, name tags, signage, and any special accommodations.</li>
          <li><strong>Host the event:</strong> Greet guests, stay attentive to donor needs, and keep the program running smoothly.</li>
          <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Send thank-you messages, record attendance, and note important conversations or feedback.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Questions to Guide Event Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Before reserving a space or designing a menu, it can help to ask:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>What do we want donors to feel at the end of this event?</li>
          <li>What stories or voices should they hear?</li>
          <li>How can we recognize their generosity in a way that feels sincere and personal?</li>
          <li>How will we follow up after the event to continue the relationship?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Events that are aligned with these questions can help donors feel more connected to the
          institution, rather than simply invited to another obligation on their calendar.
